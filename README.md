# Purpose

This example shows how automate the deployment of a web application with authentication enabled for Azure Active Directory.

Run the `Authenticate.ps1` script to authenticate.

Since this example uses both Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI, you will need to authenticate to both.

Once you are authenticated, run the `Deploy.ps1` script.
